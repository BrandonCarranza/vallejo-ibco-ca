# Code of Conduct

## Our Pledge

We as members, contributors, and leaders pledge to make participation in our community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body size, visible or invisible disability, ethnicity, sex characteristics, gender identity and expression, level of experience, education, socio-economic status, nationality, personal appearance, race, caste, color, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.

We pledge to act and interact in ways that contribute to an open, welcoming, diverse, inclusive, and healthy community focused on civic transparency and accountability.

- **Being data-focused**: Grounding discussions in verifiable facts and evidence
- **Being professional**: Maintaining professionalism even in disagreement
- **Being patient**: Recognizing that people have different skill levels and backgrounds

## Special Considerations for Civic Data Projects

Given the sensitive nature of municipal finance data and public accountability:

### Data Integrity
- Never knowingly introduce false or misleading data
- Always cite sources and acknowledge data limitations
- Report errors immediately when discovered
- Do not manipulate analysis to produce predetermined outcomes

### Political Neutrality
- This project takes no position on partisan political issues
- We analyze financial data objectively, regardless of political implications
- Personal political views should not influence data collection or analysis
- Policy advocacy is separate from factual analysis

### Respect for Public Officials
- While we hold government accountable, we treat all individuals with respect
- Criticism should focus on policies, decisions, and data—never personal attacks
- Assume good faith even when questioning decisions
- Recognize the complexity of municipal governance

### Community Engagement
- Engage constructively with residents, officials, and stakeholders
- Listen to concerns and feedback with an open mind
- Acknowledge the real-world impact of fiscal analysis on communities
- Be sensitive to how financial distress affects real people's lives

## Enforcement Responsibilities

Project maintainers are responsible for clarifying and enforcing our standards of acceptable behavior and will take appropriate and fair corrective action in response to any behavior that they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful.

Project maintainers have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that are not aligned with this Code of Conduct, and will communicate reasons for moderation decisions when appropriate.

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies within all community spaces, and also applies when an individual is officially representing the community in public spaces. Examples of representing our community include using an official email address, posting via an official social media account, or acting as an appointed representative at an online or offline event.

## Enforcement

All complaints will be reviewed and investigated promptly and fairly. The project team is obligated to maintain confidentiality with regard to the reporter of an incident.

### Enforcement Guidelines

Project maintainers will follow these Community Impact Guidelines in determining the consequences for any action they deem in violation of this Code of Conduct:

#### 1. Correction

**Community Impact**: Use of inappropriate language or other behavior deemed unprofessional or unwelcome.

**Consequence**: A private, written warning from project maintainers, providing clarity around the nature of the violation and an explanation of why the behavior was inappropriate. A public apology may be requested.

#### 2. Warning

**Community Impact**: A violation through a single incident or series of actions.

**Consequence**: A warning with consequences for continued behavior. No interaction with the people involved, including unsolicited interaction with those enforcing the Code of Conduct, for a specified period of time. This includes avoiding interactions in community spaces as well as external channels like social media. Violating these terms may lead to a temporary or permanent ban.

#### 3. Temporary Ban

**Community Impact**: A serious violation of community standards, including sustained inappropriate behavior.

**Consequence**: A temporary ban from any sort of interaction or public communication with the community for a specified period of time. No public or private interaction with the people involved, including unsolicited interaction with those enforcing the Code of Conduct, is allowed during this period. Violating these terms may lead to a permanent ban.

#### 4. Permanent Ban

**Community Impact**: Demonstrating a pattern of violation of community standards, including sustained inappropriate behavior, harassment of an individual, or aggression toward or disparagement of classes of individuals.

**Consequence**: A permanent ban from any sort of public interaction within the community.

#### 5. Data Integrity Violations

**Community Impact**: Deliberately introducing false data, manipulating analysis, or misrepresenting findings.

**Consequence**: Immediate permanent ban and public disclosure of the violation to maintain trust in data integrity. May include notification to relevant authorities if the violation constitutes fraud or criminal activity.

## Appeal Process

If you believe you have been unfairly sanctioned, you may appeal by emailing **appeals@ibco-ca.us** within 30 days of the decision. Appeals will be reviewed by project leadership not involved in the original decision.

## Transparency in Enforcement

To maintain trust in our community:
- Serious violations and their consequences will be documented
- Patterns of violations may be reported in aggregate (without identifying individuals)
- Data integrity violations will be disclosed publicly to maintain trust
- Enforcement decisions will be logged and periodically reviewed
