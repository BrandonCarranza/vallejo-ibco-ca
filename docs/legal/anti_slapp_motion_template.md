## I. NOTICE OF MOTION AND MOTION

PLEASE TAKE NOTICE that on [DATE], at [TIME], or as soon thereafter as the matter may be heard, in Department [X] of the above-entitled court, located at [COURT ADDRESS], defendant Independent Budget & Oversight Console (IBCo) will and hereby does move this Court for an order striking plaintiff's complaint in its entirety pursuant to California Code of Civil Procedure section 425.16 (the "anti-SLAPP statute").

2. IBCo's municipal fiscal analysis constitutes protected activity under CCP § 425.16(e);

3. Plaintiff cannot establish a probability of prevailing on the merits;

4. IBCo is entitled to attorney's fees and costs under CCP § 425.16(c).

## II. MEMORANDUM OF POINTS AND AUTHORITIES

### A. INTRODUCTION

This case is a textbook Strategic Lawsuit Against Public Participation (SLAPP). Plaintiff seeks to silence IBCo's constitutionally protected analysis of municipal fiscal health through frivolous litigation. California's anti-SLAPP statute exists precisely to prevent such abusive lawsuits.

IBCo is a civic transparency project that analyzes publicly available government financial documents to assess municipal fiscal health. All of IBCo's analysis:
- Is based on official government documents (CAFRs, CalPERS reports, State Controller data)
- Uses transparent, open-source methodology
- Includes prominent disclaimers
- Addresses matters of undeniable public concern

Plaintiff's lawsuit seeks to punish IBCo for exercising First Amendment rights. This Court should grant this motion and award attorney's fees.

### B. LEGAL STANDARD

#### 1. Two-Step Anti-SLAPP Analysis

The anti-SLAPP statute employs a two-step process:

**Step 1:** Defendant must make a threshold showing that the challenged claims arise from protected activity. (*Equilon Enterprises v. Consumer Cause, Inc.* (2002) 29 Cal.4th 53, 67)

**Step 2:** If defendant meets this burden, plaintiff must demonstrate a probability of prevailing on the merits. (*Navellier v. Sletten* (2002) 29 Cal.4th 82, 88)

If plaintiff cannot meet this burden, the claims must be stricken and defendant awarded attorney's fees.

#### 2. Protected Activity Under CCP § 425.16(e)

Protected activity includes:

"(2) any written or oral statement or writing made in connection with an issue under consideration or review by a legislative, executive, or judicial body, or any other official proceeding authorized by law;

(3) any written or oral statement or writing made in a place open to the public or a public forum in connection with an issue of public interest;

(4) or any other conduct in furtherance of the exercise of the constitutional right of petition or the constitutional right of free speech in connection with a public issue or an issue of public interest."

IBCo's fiscal analysis falls squarely within subsections (3) and (4).

### C. IBCO'S ANALYSIS CONSTITUTES PROTECTED ACTIVITY

#### 1. Municipal Fiscal Health Is a Matter of Public Concern

Courts consistently recognize that government fiscal matters are quintessential issues of public concern:

- **Government Performance:** Analysis of how government manages taxpayer money (*Wilbanks v. Wolk* (2004) 121 Cal.App.4th 883, 898)
- **Pension Obligations:** Public employee pension liabilities affect all taxpayers (*Desmond v. Vaske* (2015) 236 Cal.App.4th 1263, 1273)
- **Municipal Finances:** City financial health impacts all residents (*Malin v. Singer* (2013) 217 Cal.App.4th 1283, 1295)

IBCo's fiscal analysis addresses:
- Revenue sustainability and trends
- Expenditure patterns and control
- Pension and OPEB liabilities
- Fund balance adequacy
- Debt burden analysis
- Long-term fiscal projections

Each of these topics directly affects public policy, taxation, and government accountability. The public has a vital interest in understanding municipal fiscal health.

#### 2. IBCo's Speech Occurs in a Public Forum

IBCo publishes its analysis:
- On a publicly accessible website
- Via a public API
- In reports available to all
- For use by journalists, researchers, and residents

This constitutes speech "made in a place open to the public or a public forum" under CCP § 425.16(e)(3).

#### 3. IBCo's Activity Is "Conduct in Furtherance of Free Speech"

IBCo's fiscal analysis is classic protected speech:

**Data Journalism:** IBCo analyzes publicly available government documents and presents findings to the public. This is core First Amendment activity. (*Makaeff v. Trump University LLC* (2015) 240 Cal.App.4th 1045, 1062)

**Civic Transparency:** IBCo's mission is to increase government transparency and accountability. California has a strong public policy favoring access to government information. (Cal. Const. art. I, § 3(b))

**Political Commentary:** Analysis of government fiscal performance constitutes political commentary entitled to maximum First Amendment protection. (*Damon v. Ocean Hills Journalism Club* (2000) 85 Cal.App.4th 468, 479)

**Watchdog Function:** Civic organizations monitoring government serve a vital democratic function. (*Gilbert v. Sykes* (2007) 147 Cal.App.4th 13, 25)

### D. PLAINTIFF CANNOT ESTABLISH PROBABILITY OF PREVAILING

Even if this Court were to find that IBCo's analysis is not protected activity (it is), plaintiff cannot establish a probability of prevailing on the merits.

#### 1. Truth Defense (If Defamation Claim)

Every challenged statement by IBCo is:
- Based on official government documents
- Mathematically accurate
- Transparently sourced with page citations
- Independently verifiable

Truth is an absolute defense to defamation. (*Smith v. Maldonado* (1999) 72 Cal.App.4th 637, 645)

IBCo has compiled complete provenance documentation showing that every challenged data point derives from official government sources:

**[INSERT SPECIFIC DATA LINEAGE CITATIONS]**

- CAFR FY [YEAR], Page [X], Section [Y]
- CalPERS Valuation Report [DATE], Page [X]
- State Controller Report [YEAR], Table [X]

Plaintiff cannot rebut this documentary evidence.

#### 2. Opinion and Rhetorical Hyperbole

To the extent any IBCo statements constitute opinion or rhetorical hyperbole (rather than statements of fact), they are absolutely protected:

- Risk scores are explicitly labeled as "stress indicators, not predictions"
- Methodology documentation clarifies assumptions and limitations
- Disclaimers appear prominently throughout site
- Reasonable readers understand the nature of fiscal analysis

(*Milkovich v. Lorain Journal Co.* (1990) 497 U.S. 1; *Baker v. Los Angeles Herald Examiner* (1986) 42 Cal.3d 254)

#### 3. First Amendment Protections

Even if plaintiff could show false statements (which plaintiff cannot), plaintiff must also show:

**For Public Figures/Public Officials:** Actual malice (knowledge of falsity or reckless disregard for truth). (*New York Times v. Sullivan* (1964) 376 U.S. 254)

IBCo had no knowledge of falsity. All analysis is based on careful review of official documents with transparent methodology.

**For Matters of Public Concern:** Negligence is insufficient; heightened fault standard applies. (*Gertz v. Robert Welch, Inc.* (1974) 418 U.S. 323)

IBCo exercises extraordinary care:
- Manual data entry with verification
- Cross-validation with multiple sources
- Peer review of methodology
- Prompt correction of any identified errors
- Complete audit trail

#### 4. Disclaimers Defeat Reasonable Reliance

IBCo includes comprehensive disclaimers:

"**DISCLAIMER:** This is independent civic analysis, not official government data. Risk scores are stress indicators, NOT bankruptcy predictions. Users should independently verify all information. No warranties provided."

These disclaimers appear:
- On API root endpoint (`/disclaimer`)
- In every API response
- On website homepage
- In all reports and visualizations

No reasonable person could be misled. (*Khawar v. Globe Internat., Inc.* (1998) 19 Cal.4th 254, 273)

#### 5. Public Interest Outweighs Any Private Harm

Even if plaintiff could establish some technical defect in IBCo's analysis (which plaintiff cannot), the public interest in fiscal transparency far outweighs any claimed private harm.

California has a strong public policy favoring:
- Access to government information (Cal. Const. art. I, § 3(b))
- Civic watchdog organizations
- Government accountability
- Municipal finance transparency
- First Amendment protections for political speech

Suppressing IBCo's analysis would harm the public interest.

### E. ATTORNEY'S FEES AND COSTS

If this Court grants IBCo's anti-SLAPP motion (as it should), IBCo is entitled to attorney's fees and costs. CCP § 425.16(c)(1).

This mandatory fee-shifting provision serves an important purpose: deterring frivolous SLAPP suits designed to silence protected speech through expensive litigation.

### F. CONCLUSION

This case exemplifies why California enacted the anti-SLAPP statute. Plaintiff seeks to silence constitutionally protected civic transparency through meritless litigation.

The Court should:
1. **GRANT** IBCo's anti-SLAPP motion
2. **STRIKE** plaintiff's complaint in its entirety
3. **AWARD** IBCo its attorney's fees and costs
